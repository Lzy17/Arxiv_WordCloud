# Arxiv_WordCloud
Enter a KeyWord (such as Machine Learning), my code will scrape through arxiv.org and get all the related fields of study(like quantum physics, sound processing, astrophysics, etc) of that KeyWord and generate a WordCloud picture based on those related field of study.




Target.png will determine the shape of you WordCloud.

To run the code do: 

chmod -x start.sh

./start.sh
